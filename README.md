# usgs-earthquakes


## Summary
This project uses a GeoJSON data feed from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to show the locations and magnitude of all earthquakes that have occured in the past week. The data can be found at https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson. The size and colors of the circles on the map are based on the magnitude of the earthquakes.

This project uses the Leaflet and D3 Javascript libraries.
